						I graduated from Monash University in 2024 with a WAM of 78. I would
						have liked to score higher than this; however, I am still pleased with
						my efforts as my grades trended upward; this could be because my units
						became easier, but I like to think it is because I became better at
						learning, especially new programming concepts.
					</p>
					<p>Some notable grades include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>FIT2004, Algorithms and Data Structures: 86 (HD)</li>
						<li>FIT3171, Software Security: 92 (HD)</li>
						<li>FIT4002, Software Engineering Industry Experience Studio Project: 92
							(HD)</li>
						<li>FIT5125, Cloud Computing and Security: 88 (HD)</li>

						I graduated from St John's Grammar in 2019 with an Atar of 95.75. My
						units included Mathematical Methods (calculus, and statistics), Physics,
						English, and a Research Project. Additionally, as I completed Stage 2
						I.T in year 11, I was able to take two tertiary units at Flinders
						University - game design, and introduction to programming - I achieved a
						High Distinction (HD, 85+ at Flinders) in both.
