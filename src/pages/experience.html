					<p class="subscript marginless">ABOUT THE PROJECT</p>
					<p>
						In December 2023 I started developing an Auslan spell
						generation package for Monash University's department of Human Centred
						Computing. The package translates text prompts into interactive 3D
						animations, engaging the user and enhancing the learning experience. As
						this project is an npm package, it can be integrated into any website.
						We are still in the process of alpha testing; thus I cannot include a
						live demo in this website; however, I am optimistic this should change
						in the near future, so bookmark this website if you are interested :)
						<br>
						<br>
						By default the package includes UI controls (that can be hidden using
						the API) which allow users to interact with the 3D models. The
						hands can also be programatically controlled through the API, providing
						granular control over the animations. Additionally, all styles can be
						overriden by developers using the package; for simplicity there is also
						the option to only provide a colour theme.
						<br>
						<br>
						The package was designed to be highly configurable, allowing any
						developer to make it work for their usecase. Additionally, for when
						configuration fails, the package is highly extendable, meaning if a
						feature does not exist you can either fork the repository, or make a PR.
						<br>
						<br>
						Plans for the future include: integrating the package into
						<a class="link" href="https://auslan.org.au/">Sign Bank</a>, supporting
						more langauges, and creating an educational finger spelling web app.

					<p class="subscript">ABOUT ME</p>
					<p>
						This was my first time creating a package for other developers to use;
						it forced me to think carefully about how others would use the code, and
						thus how the API should be designed to accomodate these users. I believe
						this experience greatly improved my ability to design software
						architecture, as well as differentiate between good and bad design.
						Notably the package is ~2500 lines of code, this is significantly less
						than other projects I have completed; however, the effort spent on each
						line is much greater, I dedicated time to code reviews and analysis to
						simplify and reduce the code base as less code is better, this is
						especially true for packages - I'm probably not going to use your
						package if it increases cold load times. Speaking of code reviews, I
						also learned a lot about the workflow and development cycle that works
						well for me - create janky but working iterations of features to get an
						idea of the problem space, design a more elegant solution, bring the
						design to life with code, review, and finalise. A specific example of
						this approach, that I am proud of, is the code for handling animations.
						I had programmed a simple solution that worked for most cases but had a
						some major issues, this first iteration helped me understand the problem
						and brainstorm solutions. Eventually I created a datastructure and class
						that handled the animations perfectly, even allowing me to scrub the
						animation (similar to a youtube video) this is especially cool because
						we are playing and blending multiple animations, so something like
						<code>mixer.update(seconds)</code> (the usual approach) would not work
						as the blending would break.
						<br>
						<br>
						The last thing I will say is that I really enjoyed working on this
						project as it became clear that my years of study and work have
						culminated in, if I do say so myself, a rather good programmer.

					<p>
						Soon after I resigned from my position at Woolworths I began work on the
						frontend for <a class="link"
							href="https://ilearneducation.com.au/">iLearn Education</a>.
						iLearn Education provides in person tutoring services; however, they
						wanted to expand to online courses where students could practice for
						NAPLAN exams, and scholarship & entry tests; the website allows students
						to view their results and compare to other students to get an idea of
						where they would place for the official tests. Additionally, the website
						posts blogs to inform parents of the actions they can take to give their
						child the best chance for success.
					</p>
					<p>
						This project was the first where I designed (alone) the frontend
						architecture, in the process I made a few technical mistakes that came
						from an overzealous attempt to apply programming principles & patterns
						(dependency injection, factories, etc.); technically, the code is more
						extendable; however, we refactored more than we added new features
						making the abstractions an annoyance.
