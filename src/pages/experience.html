					<p class="subscript marginless">ABOUT THE PROJECT</p>
					<p>
						In December 2023 I started developing an Auslan spell generation package
						for Monash University's Department of Human Centred Computing. The
						package translates text prompts into interactive 3D animations, engaging
						the user and enhancing the learning experience. As this project is an
						npm package, it can be integrated into any website. We are still in the
						process of alpha testing; thus I cannot include a live demo on this
						website; however, I am optimistic this should change shortly, so
						bookmark this website if you are interested :)
						<br>
						<br>
						By default, the package includes UI controls (that can be hidden using
						the API) which allow users to interact with the 3D models. The hands can
						also be programmatically controlled through the API, providing granular
						control over the animations. Additionally, all styles can be overridden
						by developers using the package; for simplicity, there is also the
						option to only provide a colour theme.
						<br>
						<br>
						The package was designed to be highly configurable, allowing any
						developer to make it work for their use case. Additionally, for when
						configuration fails, the package is highly extendable, meaning if a
						feature does not exist you can either fork the repository or make a PR.
						<br>
						<br>
						Plans for the future include: integrating the package intoÂ <a
							class="link" href="https://auslan.org.au/">Sign Bank</a>,
						supporting more languages, and creating an educational finger spelling
						web app.

					<p class="subscript">ABOUT ME</p>
					<p>

						This was my first time creating a package for other developers to use;
						it forced me to think carefully about how others would use the code, and
						thus how the API should be designed to accommodate these users. I
						believe this experience greatly improved my ability to design software
						architecture, as well as differentiate between good and bad design.
						Notably, the package is ~2500 lines of code, this is significantly less
						than other projects I have completed; however, the effort spent on each
						line is much greater, I dedicated time to code reviews and analysis to
						simplify and reduce the code base as less code is better, this is
						especially true for packages - I'm probably not going to use your
						package if it increases cold load times. Speaking of code reviews, I
						also learned a lot about the workflow and development cycle that works
						well for me - create janky but working iterations of features to get an
						idea of the problem space, design a more elegant solution, bring the
						design to life with code, review, and finalise. A specific example of
						this approach, that I am proud of, is the code for handling animations.
						I had programmed a simple solution that worked for most cases but had
						some major issues, this first iteration helped me understand the problem
						and brainstorm solutions. Eventually, I created a data structure and
						class that handled the animations perfectly, even allowing me to scrub
						the animation (similar to a YouTube video) this is especially cool
						because we are playing and blending multiple animations, so something
						like <code>mixer.update(seconds)</code> (the usual approach) would not
						work as the blending would break.
						<br>
						<br>
						The last thing I will say is that I really enjoyed working on this
						project as it became clear that my years of study and work have
						culminated in, if I do say so myself, a rather good programmer.

					<p>
						Soon after I resigned from my position at Woolworths I began work on the
						frontend for <a class="link"
							href="https://ilearneducation.com.au/">iLearn Education</a>.
						iLearn Education currently provides in-person tutoring services;
						however, they are expanded online to offer courses where students can
						practice for NAPLAN exams, and scholarship & entry tests. The website
						allows students to view their results and compare them to other students
						providing insight into where they might place for the official tests.
						Additionally, the website posts blogs to inform parents of the actions
						they can take to maximise their child's chance of success.

					<p class="subscript">ABOUT ME</p>
					<p>
						This project was the first where I designed (alone) the frontend
						architecture, in the process I made a few technical mistakes that came
						from an overzealous attempt to apply programming principles & patterns
						(dependency injection, factories, etc.). Technically, the code is more
						extendable; however, we refactored more than we added new features
						making the abstractions hindrance. I think my main takeaway from this
						experience is: that premature optimisation will (mostly) be a hindrance,
						it is better to solve the problem in the most simple way, and only add
						abstractions when a clear need arises.
						<br>
						<br>
						I was able to take these learnings to my next role as a Casual Research
						Officer, which helped me circumnavigate many of the problems I
						encountered in this project; however, it is worth noting that this
						project had a greater scope, and thus it was much harder to keep the
						code clean and organised.

					<p class="subscript">ABOUT THE PROJECT</p>
					<p>

						FIT4002 is Monash University's Industry Experience unit, essentially,
						you join a team and then are assigned a project and client. It is up to
						the team how they want to organise everything - roles, version control,
						tech stack (to an extent), etc. I ended up choosing a team that was a
						subset of a larger team from a previous unit, I knew everyone in this
						team would contribute and work well together. We were assigned a project
						managed by
						<a class="link"
							href="https://www.monash.edu/it/humanise-lab/about-us/our-students/jonny-low">Jonny
							Low</a>,
						the project was a cross-platform mental health triage (prototype)
						application. The application included roles for admins, nurses, and
						nurse leaders; each role had different requirements, and thus different
						features and UI. I won't bore you with a detailed explanation, instead,
						I recommend watching the demo video
						<a class="link"
							href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj6vawIVE68">here</a>
						(same as the embedded video), you can also watch a condensed version

						Mr. Low has his own publication of the application if

					<p class="subscript">ABOUT ME</p>
					<p>
						I learned a lot from the team on this project, specifically the other
						lead developer (who ended up getting dux); I believe this was the first
						time I recognised the code written by another developer was much better
						than what I could accomplish (with my current knowledge). I actually use
						very similar (de) serialisation logic in most of my projects now because
						it works so well. What I took away from this (other than specific code
						ideas) is: to read other people's code, especially people who are better
						at programming than me.
						<br>
						<br>
						As lead developers, Andre and I were responsible for the codebase, early
						on we had to deny some PRs because of React mistakes, this was
						understandable as most had not worked with the framework before; instead
						of reproaching the team, I suggested we hold a 2-3 hour workshop, in
						which, I would go over React basics and teach the team how to avoid some
						of the mistakes we had observed. This workshop worked well, the code
						noticeably improved, and the team said they found it useful.
						<br>
						<br>
						Most of my experience has been on solo projects, or on projects where
						the teams are very siloed, this was the first proper project where I
						worked with a team of this size. I found the experience of working with
						other developers to be very enjoyable, it allowed me to focus more on
						architecture design and implementation rather than specific features. I
						think I enjoy this more as I find designing architecture allows me to
						express my understanding in more interesting ways.

						If there's one thing I learned from this job, it is that I never want to

						it was very helpful for building my soft skills - communication,
						teamwork, time management, etc. I worked at Woolworths while studying,
						this improved my time management and organisational skills - it taught
						me how to balance a social life (living on campus), with studies, and
						work, a skill I'm sure I'll be using for the rest of my life.
