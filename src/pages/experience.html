					<p class="subscript marginless">ABOUT THE PROJECT</p>
					<p>
						In December 2023 I started developing an Auslan spell
						generation package for Monash University's department of Human Centred
						Computing. The package translates text prompts into interactive 3D
						animations,
						engaging the user and enhancing the learning experience.

						As this project is an npm package, it can be integrated into any
						website.
						We are still in the process of alpha testing; thus I cannot
						include a live demo on this website; however, I am optimistic this
						should change
						in the near future, so bookmark this website if you are interested :)
						<br>
						<br>
						By default the package includes UI controls (that can be hidden using
						the API) which allow users to interact with the 3D models (play/pause,
						speed multipliers, scrubbing, camera controls). However, the hands can
						also be programatically controlled through an API, providing granular
						control over the animations. Additionally, all styles can be overriden
						by developers using the package; for simplicity there is also the option
						to only provide a colour theme.
						<br>
						<br>
						The package was designed to be highly configurable, allowing any
						developer to make it work for their usecase. Additionally, for when
						configuration fails, the package is highly extendable, meaning if a
						feature does not exist you can either fork the repository, or make a PR.
						<br>
						<br>
						Plans for the future include: integrating the package into
						<a class="link" href="https://auslan.org.au/">Sign Bank</a>, supporting
						more langauges, and creating a finger spelling learning web app.

					<p class="subscript">ABOUT ME</p>
					<p>
						I think the key skill I developed working on this project was
						architecture design; specifically, the design of a modular,
						maintainable, and extendable codebase. A tangible example of this design
						approach is the hands controller, an interface used to interact with the
						3D models. Dependency injection is applied to make adding new
						controllers convenient, this is crucial as different file types -
						<code>.gltf</code>, <code>.dae</code>, etc - require separate
						implementations.
