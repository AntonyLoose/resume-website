				I started programming journey at 13 years old by creating foosball game using the
				Construct game engine, at the time I thought I was going to be a professional football
				(soccer) player, I don't think pre-highschool me envisioned sitting at a desk all day
				and having back problems as a 22 y.o, but here I am, and I don't regret a thing. I
				didn't know I wanted to be software engineer until about halfway through my final year
				of highschool, at this time I was completing an introductory programming unit at
				Flinders University (<b>talk about how you were fortunate enough to study a uni unit in
					highschool</b>); Java of all languages was what made me realise I wanted to
				spend at significant amount of my life looking at a screen. After picking a degree, I
				had a choose a University, I still clearly remember some Monash affilates coming to my
				school and describing how good Monash is, of course when talking about accomodation
				they showed the expensive apartments, so I was somewhat suprised when I rocked up to
				a... charming 1960's building; however, I ended up forging many of my closest
				relationships in this place, so I look back upon it fondly. I enjoyed each year of
				university more than the last, I felt like I was learning a lot and my programming was
				improving rapidly, of course when I started my first proper project I realised how
				little I actually knew; however, this only encouraged me, I could only imagine how high
				the skill cieling is if it took me 3 years of full time study to not suck.

				<br>
				<br>

				I have been working in the industry for about a year, and I already feel like I have
				learned so much, and I can't wait to learn and build more.
